-   First create an account on Transifex using a proper nickname and a real email address (it will be used to give you credit for your contributions, and so that we're able to contact you later if we need further translation help).

-   Always match newlines and whitespace with translation strings: if a string has 4 spaces in the beginning of it in English, do the same thing for the translation. If a string has 2 newlines at the end of it, or one in the middle and another at the end, repeat the same thing in the translated string.
