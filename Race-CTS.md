Race CTS (= Complete The Stage)
===============================

Object of the Game
------------------

This is an advanced mode of [Race](Race). Difference here is that you - instead of running laps - have to reach the finish. The player who sets the fastest time wins after the time is over.


Physics
-------

CTS can use any phyics, but [XDF](XDF) is the default physics set, based on the [Quake DeFRaG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeFRaG) mod.

Map Entities
------------

 - *Speed Buff* - Found at the start, or sometimes middle of maps, this buff gives you a quicker initial acceleration
 - *Shield* - Currently damage is off, this item does nothing
 - *Armor* - Currently damage is off, this item does nothing. *Some exceptions apply*
 - *Health* - Currently damage is off, this item does nothing. *Some exceptions apply*
 - *Jet Pack* - This is used to fly
 - *Decorative* - Some maps have entities you cannot, or should not pick up as they are just decorative

Weapons
-------

Some maps use weapons.

 - *Rocket Launcher* - Aim at the ground or walls, gain speed
 - *Hagar* - Aim in front, towards your feet at a low angle, wall climb
 - *Mortar* - Aim in front, towards your feet at a low angle, gain height
 - *Crylink* - Aim behind, towards ground or wall, speed, distance

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

 - The physics are different in Race CTS if a server runs the mod ‘[Xonotic Pro Mode](Xonotic Pro Mode)’.
 - You can’t push (/frag) other players like in Race.
 - In console (shift+esc), type "bind k kill" to bind the "k" kill to the suicide action. Put in autoexec.cfg to persist.
 - Pay attention to the speed meter in the cent of your screen

Bunny-hopping
------------

 - In Xonotic, hold spacebar while moving forward to bunnyhop

Circle-jumping
--------------

 - At the start of the map, a circle jump can be used to gain a speed boost of 500+ qu/s vs. ~300 from a cold start.

Slick Surfaces
--------------

Strafe-jumping
--------------

Ramp-jumping
------------

Turning
-------

 - TODO: Turning is nuanced, harder to explain (komier)
