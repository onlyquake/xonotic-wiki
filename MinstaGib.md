MinstaGib Mutator:
==================

Overview
--------

Typically known as “instagib” in most other arena shooters, MinstaGib replaces all weaponry with the [MinstaNex](Weapons#minstanex). It is a powerful hitscan weapon that will immediately kill the target player in one shot. MinstaGib is a popular mutator that mixes well with almost all gamemodes and may be included in many Xonotic servers. When participating in a MinstaGib match, one must have particularly good aim and conserve shots whenever possible.
