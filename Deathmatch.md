Deathmatch (DM)
===============

Object of the Game
------------------

Deathmatch is one of the most popular classic gamemodes in Xonotic (and also the easiest). It is a simple free-for-all fight to the death where everyone plays versus everyone. There are no teams or alliances, each player is on his/her own and one must fight for their own survival.

Scoring
-------

| Action | Score |
|:------:|:-----:|
| Kill an opponent | +1 |
| Kill yourself | -1 |

Killing an opponent is also known as a “frag”. The first player to reach the frag limit (default: 30) will win the match.

Map Entities
------------

-   **Weapons** - These can be picked up from various places around the map or from a downed player.
-   **Ammo** - These may be found in the form of shells, bullets, rockets, jet fuel, or power cells.
-   **Powerups** - All maps have “Health” and “Armor” powerups, which extend your lifetime. Some maps may contain 
powerups like “[Strength](Powerups#strength)” or “[Shield](Powerups#shield)” (which usually spawn every 2 minutes).

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

-   Always keep moving. This can be especially true for smaller maps and/or very crowded matches. If you stay in one place for too long, you risk becoming an easy target.
-   If your map contains powerups such as the ones mentioned above, make good use of them. They can be useful tools to win a match!
-   Keep your suicides at a minimum. Your point counter *can* enter into the negatives, so always avoid self-injury.
-   If a player is approaching you fast and there are “Mega Health” or “Mega Armor” powerups nearby, grab them first! This can deprive the opponent of a chance to heal himself once shot.
