Object of the Game
------------------

In KH there are 3 teams (red; blue & yellow) and always one player of a team holds a key (Red key; blue key & yellow key). The goal is to collect the keys of the other teams and gather up to score. Get 1000 points to win a map (100 points for each capture).
Tricky: Everyone that holds a key (Note: you can hold more than 1 of course) has a waypoint over his head (“Key carrier”), which shows his position.

How To:

- Collect a key? Frag a player which holds a key and grab it (walk over it) after he died.
- Score? Your team needs to collect all keys. If, for example, Player A, B and C of 1 team hold a team they have to meet a one place (can be anywhere) and be close enough together. That’s enough to score. Its possible that one player gets every key and he scores immediately then.

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

- Some maps can contain powerups like “[Strength](../Powerups#strength)” or “[Shield](../Powerups#shield)” (which usually 
spawn every 2 minutes). They can be useful tools to win a match!
- [Binds](../Binds) are very useful again to coordinate the team.
