# What does a vehicle do in Xonotic?

There are several types of vehicles available in Xonotic to make team play more fun. Some vehicles are automatic like a robot; others need at least one player to operate (drive or pilot). Some vehicles need, in addition to a driver/pilot, one more more shooters to operate the weapons on the vehicles. Some vehicles are not equipped with weapons but can carry a lot of players.

# Where are vehicles available?

Vehicles are available in maps that support them, i.e. maps that have vehicle placed in them. The map makers, or the mappers, have to put vehicles in maps for players to play.

Any standard servers support vehicles if they include maps with veheciles placed in them. Some servers features only large maps for vehicles.

# Unofficial vehicles

On some servers, one may find experiment vehicles that are not official. Please post your opinions on them in [Xonotic Official Forums](http://forums.xonotic.org).

# Notes for developers

`Assault` needs testing, as far as i can tell it should work now.

`ons/dom` is UNSUPPORTED, as in targeting vehicles with those ents - this is in development.

Maps needed, `as` and `ctf` for now - i cant take this much further w/o play testing on a larger scale.
