Invincible Projectiles
======================

Overview
--------
By default, some projectiles can take damage and even be destroyed by shooting them in mid-air, although this might be a little difficult to do.

**Invincible Projectiles** is a mutator that makes projectiles immune to damage; they can no long be destroyed like this.

There is one big exception, however: The electric mines from the [Weapons#Electro](Electro) can still be detonated by the Electro's combo shot (attack mines with primary Electro fire).

CVars
-----
This is enabled with the [CVar](CVars): `g_invincible_projectiles`.
