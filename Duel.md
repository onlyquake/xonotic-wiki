1v1 Duel
========

Object of the Game
------------------

Duel is one of the most competitive game mode in Xonotic. It is basically a 1v1 Deathmatch, usually played with the XPM (Xonotic Pro Mode) ruleset and with no powerups (no Strength and no Shield), but that is not mandatory.  
The player with the most frags at the end of the timelimit (or the first player to hit the fraglimit, if any) wins the match.

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

Items control is very important on duels: if you manage to take the Mega Armor and the Mega Health when they spawn, you are harder to kill and your enemy is more likely to be less stacked than you are.  
Keep in mind that mega items respawn every 30 seconds.
