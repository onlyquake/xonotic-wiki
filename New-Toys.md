# New Toys

## Overview
**New Toys** is a mutator that will spawn new, more gimmicky weapons in the arena: Heavy Laser Assault Cannon, Rifle, T.A.G. Seeker and Mine Layer. They will spawn sometimes in the place of where a core weapon would normally spawn with a chance of 50%.

These weapons might also have dedicated spawns on some maps (such as Tech Assault).

## Weapons

### Heavy Laser Assault Cannon (HLAC)

-  **Might spawn instead of:** Arc and Machine Gun
-  **Primary:** Rapid-fire laser particles, dealing a small amount of knockback and 10-13 damage.
-  **Secondary:** Fire a single, broadly scattered shot.
-  **Ammunition:** Cells

### Rifle

-  **Might spawn instead of:** Vortex
-  **Primary:** Fire a shot which pierces through walls, dealing 80-90 damage to an enemy hit, for 10 ammo.
-  **Secondary:** Fire a faster, somewhat scattered shot with reduced damage.
-  **Ammunition:** Bullets (magazine size 80)

The Rifle is likely the best sniper weapon that is not a super weapon.

### T.A.G. Seeker

- **Might spawn instead of:** Hagar
- **Primary:** Fire a particle called a “tag”. If that particle hits, one may continue to hold down the primary fire button to launch homing explosives as long as the target is in sight, dealing 20-40 damage with each hit.
- **Secondary:** Launch a rapid barrage of explosives with a short range.

Hint: Use the Mine Layer to protect isolated areas of the map, particularly important areas such as those that contain weapons, powerups, control points in Onslaught, flags in CTF, and checkpoints in Assault.

The T.A.G. Seeker is very powerful. It usually does at least 80 damage before an enemy can escape it, sometimes more, often killing the enemy very quickly.

### Mine Layer

- **Might spawn instead of:** Devastator
- **Primary:** Place mines on the ground, which deal 20-40 damage if stepped on by an enemy. These persist for 10 seconds before exploding. Up to 3 mines may be placed at a time.
- **Secondary:** Detonate all mines immediately.
