Keepaway
========

Object of the Game
------------------

In Keepaway, a ball will spawn randomly on the map. The goal is to take the ball and—when you have it—kill as many people as possible and protect yourself.

Scoring
-------

The default scoring as of 0.8.2 is as follows:

| Action | Score |
|:-:|:-:|
| Kill an opponent while you hold the ball | +1 |
| Kill the ball carrier | +1 |

Other kills score no points.

The first player to reach the frag limit (usually 30) will win the match.

### Custom scoring

Servers can change the scoring system with [CVars](CVars) (`g_keepway_score_*`). The score you get for kills can be changed.

Additionally, it's possible to also award players with points based on time, solely for carrying the ball around.

Detailed rules
--------------

* If nobody collects the ball for a while, it will teleport to a random place
