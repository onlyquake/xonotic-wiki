Overkill Tutorial
=================

Work-in-progress

Overkill is a mod of Xonotic focusing on faster movement and a simpler weapons system. Games are generally more chaotic than in vanilla Xonotic due to spawning near teammates and very high speed.

Movement
========

Movement in Overkill is based on several key concepts. It's basically [vanilla](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner) movement plus dodging so everything [here](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#movement) applies (and is covered in more detail)

Bunny Hopping
-------------

[Same as vanilla](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#bunny-hopping) - instead of running you should jump because it's much faster. Basically **hold space pressed all the time**. No exceptions unless you want to be slow. Hold forward to move straight, release forward and hold left or right to turn.

Laser / Blaster
---------------

All weapons in overkill have the same secondary fire - laser (sometimes called blaster). It doesn't affect enemies in any way but pushes the player who's using it (and also flags and nades) away. It's main uses are:

 - Jumping higher - Just aim at the floor and shoot.
 - Climbing walls - No matter how high, if you keep shooting the laser at roughly 45Â° down against a wall, you can climb up.
 - Accelerating - shoot the floor or wall slightly behind you for a noticeable boost. [Here](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#wall-blastering) with pictures.

Dodging
-------

This one is specific to Overkill and is one of it's defining features. When you're either standing still or running along a wall, quickly press forward (or any other direction) key twice. Must be followed by bunny hopping or you lose your speed as soon as you touch the floor.

You should do this every time right after spawning because this is the fastest way to start moving. When wall-dodging you gain even more speed by mixing it with the blaster. Don't underestimate this. You'll be several times faster than normally.

Advanced - Nade Jumping
-----------------------

Desperate times call for desperate measures. Sometimes, especially with the flag, you need to away fast. The best way to do that is to let a nade explode in your hand. Just press G, face away from where you want to go and wait.

A nade does between 100 and 200 damage - you need additional armor or health for this trick.

Items
=====

- Health - 100
- Armor - 100, 50, 25
- Shards - from dead enemies - important on maps without other pickups or duels

Not much to say here except **don't ignore them**. If you think there is no reason to pick them up because you'll die quickly anyway, you're wrong! Even that 5 armor shard will keep you alive when hit by the vortex. They won't make you be invincible but you will have time to shoot back or get to cover. Big difference.

Weapons
=======

On spawn you get 3 weapons and grenades with 2 additional weapons as pickups on some maps. 

    - Vortex [Long distance weapon, precise]
        - main weapon - good enough in every situation - 100% accuracy
        - Use to shoot nades further
    - Shotgun [Close proximity weapon with large spread]
        - More dmg than nex, great at close range
        - Use to slow enemies down (eg. when jumping across on space-elevator)
    - Machine Gun [Mid-range weapon with a bit of spread]
        - spread increases gradually - best to use bursts in mid range
        - most dmg/s X last resort ( enemy can kill instantly you with nex/shotgun)
        - also slows enemies down
        - is supposed to penetrate thin walls X buggy
 
    - Super Weapons
        - only on some maps - shouldn't focus on them too much
 
        - Heavy Machine Gun [needs description]
            - Point at general direction of enemy, press fire, enemy dead
            - Really strong, huge magazine
                - (i think the dmg we have in our config is not in master yet, will try to fix that)
            - defense - get further away - too uch spread
        - Rocket Propelled Chainsaw Launcher [needs description]
            - huge shockwave, one hit kill in a small radius
            - defense - keep jumping into the air - impossible to aim with it

    - Nades
        - the longer you wait, the stronger throw
        - bounce around corner ( the only overkill weapon )
        - explosion can damage thru walls
        - crouch before "throwing" -> dropped on floor
        - use G (drop weapon) - not E - need free fingers - not keep holding a key like a moron for 5 seconds
