InstaGib Mutator:
=================

Overview
--------

InstaGib replaces all weaponry with the [Vaporizer](Weapons#vaporizer). It is a powerful hitscan weapon that will immediately kill the target player in one shot (unless they got an extra life). InstaGib is a popular mutator that mixes well with almost all game modes and may be included in many Xonotic servers. When participating in an InstaGib match, one must have particularly good aim and conserve shots whenever possible.

Rules
-----

* Everyone gets the Vaporizer with 10 cells (=10 shots)
* If you run out of ammo and don't find new ammo for 10 seconds, you die and lose a point
* Strength [powerup](Powerups) is replaced by Invisibility
* Shield powerup is replaced by Speed
* [Mega Health](Items) is replaced by Extra Life
* The cells [item](Items) only gives you 5 cells

Details
---------------
-   Power cell ammunition may be difficult to find on some maps, but can be picked up readily from a downed player.
-   InstaGib has some unique collectibles:
    - Invisibility: Makes you (nearly) invisible for 30 seconds
    - Speed: Greatly increases your movement for 30 seconds
    - Extra Life: Grants you one or more extra lives (amount depends on settings). Extra lives act like armor, when you got hit with an extra life left, you will survive the shot but suffer a very strong pushbash
