h3. Tenshihan

Tenshihan has already started to create new sounds for Xonotic.
His first batch of sounds are here http://www.nullgaming.com/stuff/tenshihan-nexuiz.v6.6.pk3.zip
He is *very* excited to work on this new game with us.
He and his wife are working on new female and male player sounds right now, including a "Welcome to Xonotic" intro.
