Object of the Game
------------------

Freeze Tag is a round-based game with teams. The objective is to freeze all the opposing teams, until only one team remains. Freeze Tag can be played with 2-4 teams.

When a player is fragged, they are frozen. Frozen team mates can be unfrozen by standing close to them.

The surviving team wins the round and collects 1 point. By the default rules, the first team to reach 10 points in total, or the first team to be 6 points in the lead, wins the match. (The score requirement can of course be changed.)

How To:

- Freeze an enemy? Just shoot at him until he is frozen (its similar to a frag).
- Revive a teammate? Stand close to a frozen teammate for some seconds (it shows for how long you need to stay).

Other rules
-----------

* Players will unfreeze themselves automatically after 60 seconds
* When you fall into the bottomless pit, you will respawn frozen
* When you join in a round in progress, you spawn frozen

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

- Some maps can contain powerups like “[Strength](Powerups#strength)” or “[Shield](Powerups#shield)” (which usually 
spawn every 2 minutes). They can be useful tools to win a match!
- [Binds](Binds) are very useful again to coordinate the team.
- You can freeze (or get frozen) in e.g. lava too! Also if you fall into space you will respawn frozen.
