h1. Hinting

By default, the map is broken into 1024x1204x1024 cubes, called "leafs". These leafs are then only rendered if the user can see them. Using hint brushes allows you to break the map up into leafs of your own creation.


Take the following image for example:

This is a map shown from the top down. As you can see, there are three sections to this map: the left room, the right room, and the top hallway. Now, let's say the player is in the left room. They can't see into the right room,  but they can partially see into the hallway. However, since there is no hint brushes, the whole map is rendered for the player. This means an FPS drop.

So let's use hint brushes. Create two rectangular brushes to the entrances of both rooms and set their textures to common/hint. Make sure that the side which says "HINT SKIP" on it is facing into the corridor.

Now we've put a hint brush across the entrances to the two rooms, shown here by a white line. Now, a player standing in the left room looking at the hallway will only render those two rooms, meaning that the fps will be higher, particularly if there is a lot of prisms in the two rooms.
