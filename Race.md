Race
====

Object of the Game
------------------

In **Race**, the map is a race track and you have to run through the map and complete laps as fast as possible.

Gameplay
--------
The map will have a start/finish point and checkpoints. To complete a lap, you start at the start/finish point and  run to each checkpoint in the correct order and then to the start/finish point again. In some maps, there can be branching paths and multiple checkpoints will be shown. In this case, you can choose which path to take. The HUD will show you where you have to run next.

Your goal is to get the fastest time.

You can push other players away or even frag them!

Weapons
-------

In some maps/servers you can use weapons to speed yourselves up.

- **Blaster** and **Devastator**: Aim at the ground or walls, gain speed
- **Hagar**: Aim in front, towards your feet at a low angle, wall climb
- **Mortar**: Aim in front, towards your feet at a low angle, gain height
- **Crylink**: Aim behind, towards ground or wall, speed, distance

Physics
-------

Race can use any phyics, but [XDF](XDF) is the default physics set, based on the [Quake DeFRaG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeFRaG) mod.

### Maneuvers
*This section is incomplete.*

#### Bunny-hopping

- In Xonotic, hold spacebar while moving forward to bunnyhop

#### Circle-jumping

- At the start of the map, a circle jump can be used to gain a speed boost of 500+ qu/s vs. ~300 from a cold start.

#### Slick Surfaces
*To be written.*

#### Strafe-jumping
*To be written.*

#### Ramp-jumping
*To be written.*

#### Turning
*TODO: Turning is nuanced, harder to explain (komier)*

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

- The physics are different if a server runs the mod ‘[Xonotic Pro Mode](Xonotic Pro Mode)’.
- Servers often tend to modify the physics/gameplay heavily. Make sure to read the info text (default key: “i”).
- If you think you screwed up and want to restart, use the suicide key (default “k”) for a fast respawn
- Pay attention to the speed meter in the center of your screen
