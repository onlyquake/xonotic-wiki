Overkill Tutorial
=================

*Work-in-progress*

Overkill is a Xonotic mod characterized by

- fast movement,
- fewer but more powerful weapons,
- nades and
- respawning near team mates.

To excel at overkill there are two things to practice: aim and speed. If you're feeling old or your reflexes aren't that good, don't despair: Speed is the more important of the two. Some people focus on movement almost exclusively. Accuracy won't help your enemy if he can't keep up with your speed.

Movement
========

Every [vanilla movement tip](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#movement) also applies in Overkill. However there is one key aspect making the game way faster - **dodging**. But let's review the basics first:

Bunny Hopping
-------------

[Same as vanilla](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#bunny-hopping) - instead of just walking around you should always jump because it's much faster. Basically keep the `jump` key pressed (by default `space bar`) all the time. The only exceptions to this rule are if you *want* to be slow (to not fall off a ledge) or you need to sneak (but then you should crouch because walking makes sounds as well).

The turning and strafing tips also apply: hold `forward` to move straight, release `forward` and press `left` or `right` while moving the mouse slow but steadily in that direction to turn.

Laser / Blaster
---------------

All weapons in Overkill have the same secondary fire - laser (sometimes called blaster). It pushes the player using it (and also flags and nades), but unlike in vanilla it doesn't deal any damage. So blast away, literally.

Its main uses are:

- jumping higher - just aim at the floor and shoot
- climbing walls - no matter how high, just keep shooting the laser at roughly 45Â° down against a wall
- accelerating - shoot the floor or wall [slightly behind you](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#wall-blastering) for a noticeable boost.

Dodging
-------

### When starting to move:

Dodging Overkill's defining feature. Most people notice that quickly pressing a movement key twice dodges in that direction. When starting to move this can be used to quickly gain a little extra tempo by pressing `forward` twice. Remember to bunnyhop or else you lose your just gained speed instantly. (Press W, W, then space - don't press space before the first W or it won't work)

### Wall-dodging

Dodging does not only apply to starting a movement, but can be used on every (more or less) even surface next to you. For example you can bunnyhop alongside a wall and press the `forward` key in quick succession to gain more speed. You can do this multiple times with only a short cooldown time. You can reach very high speeds using wall dodging, good maps to try this out are [Tarx](Maps#tarx) and [Equinox](Maps#equinox).

The fastest way to accelerate is a combination of both wall-dodging and blastering. This has to be timed well to gain the most acceleration.

Nade Jumping
------------

Desperate situations call for desperate measures. Sometimes you need to get away *really* fast. One way to do that is to let a nade explode in your hand. This can be done by either facing in the opposite direction of where you want to be hurled or by being in the upward motion of a jump when the nade explodes. [Space Elevator](Maps#space-elevator) is a good map to try this out.

Since a nade does about 160 damage you need additional armor or health for this trick, otherwise you'd just commit suicide.

Weapons
=======

Basic Weapons
-------------

Every player has the same three weapons. You don't have to collect them and you also have infinite ammo. The only thing you have to care about is to choose the right weapon for a task and timing the reloads.

- Vortex (also called nex, long distance, perfectly precise)
  - the main weapon, good in almost every situation
- Shotgun (close range, with spread)
  - more damage than vortex but only in short range
  - faster rate of fire
  - slows enemies down - shoot them when they're jumping across a chasm to make them fall
- Machine Gun (also knows as uzi, mid-range weapon with a bit of spread)
  - spread increases gradually, so shoot short bursts
  - also slows enemies down
  - can deal small amounts of damage through walls

Never reload in the middle of a fight. Switch to a different gun. It's much faster.

Super Weapons
-------------

Those weapons have to be picked up and are only available on some maps.

- Heavy Machine Gun
  - this is basically the machine gun - only it's bigger, faster, has a larger ammo capacity and is even more powerful
  - point at general direction of enemy, pull the trigger, enemy dead
- Rocket Propelled Chainsaw Launcher
  - this sounds more fun than it actually is, basically it's a rocket launcher
  - slow rockets, huge damage, quite a damage radius
  - you'll have a hard time not killing yourself with it, so you better jump around while using it and not aim at walls next to you

Nades
-----

Nade is the shorthand term for *grenade*. It deals quite a lot of damage in a large radius. You get a new nade every few seconds.

You can arm a nade by pressing the `drop weapon` bind (by default the `g` key). After that a countdown starts until the nade explodes. You have to press the `drop weapon` key again to throw it.

To excel at nading here are a few tips:

* Keep the nade in hand until just before the explosion and throw it at an enemy. That way the nade won't bounce off and the enemy has no way to dodge it. You throw with more force the longer you wait.
* Or you can use nades like a mine by dropping it on the floor at a place where an enemy will very likely be in a few moments (e.g. the flag spot in a CTF match). You can easily drop a nade by crouching before releasing it.
  * This has it's uses but usually you'll just waste a nade.
* You can also use nades like a rocket launcher by throwing them in front of you and then shooting it with the vortex. This propels the nade very far and causes very high damage with quite a bit of spread. It takes a little practice but is definitely worth the effort.
* Also keep in mind nades bounce off walls and fall down stairs. They even deal **damage through walls**.

### Shooting nades



Items
=====

There's not much to say here except **take everything you get**. If you think there's no reason to pick up items because you'll die quickly anyway, you're wrong! Remember without any pickups a single vortex hit will instantly kill you. **Even that tiny 5 armor shard dropped by a killed enemy will keep you alive** and win you time to shoot back or get in cover. A fully equipped player (max health at 200 and max armor at 100) will sustain three vortex hits. If the hits don't come in quick succession even four, because you're healing shortly after being hit.

In a 1on1 game you should even pick up items if you're already maxed out. You won't gain any extra health/armor, but you deprive your enemies of that bonus making it easier for you. When playing in a team however you better leave the items for your partners, especially flag carriers in CTF.

The small (5) shard is dropped by killed enemies. As noted above, it's more useful than it looks.
