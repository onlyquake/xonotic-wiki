Grappling Hook mutator
======================
This mutator gives all players an off-hand [Grappling Hook](Weapons#grappling-hook).

The grappling hook fires a chain that attaches to surfaces and drags you towards it. To fire, press the “hook” key (default: E).

A detailed description of the grappling hook is given [here](Weapons#grappling-hook), but this mutator has the following differences:

* You have infinite shots (no fuel required)
* The grappling hook is off-hand, you can't and needn't select it as a weapon
* The secondary fire is not available
