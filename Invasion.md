**Invasion** is a highly **experimental** game mode in which the players fight together against hordes of monsters.

Gameplay
--------
The game is played in rounds. In each round, a certain number of monsters will spawn all around the map. The players must try to kill as many monsters as possible. The players can't deal damage to other players.

A round ends if either all monsters are dead or after a timeout. The next round will start soon and after each round, the monsters will become more dangerous.

The player who killed the monsters wins the match.

The monsters
------------
As of version 0.8.2, there are spider bots, zombies, evil wizards and various monsters. They might drop health packs when killed.
