Weapons Stay
------------
**Weapons Stay** is a mutator in which the weapons at weapon spawn points don't fully disappear after being collected, instead they will turn red.

While red, anyone can still walk over the weapon to collect it, but it will only give the weapon, no ammo.

In this mutator, weapons will still “respawn” after being collected. This just turns a red weapon back to normal again, meaning it will give you the weapon and ammo.
