h1. Repository Access

The repository is accessed using git.

h2. Linux/OS X:

First, you install git using your favorite package manager. Then:

<pre>
git clone git://git.xonotic.org/xonotic/xonotic.git
cd xonotic
./all update
</pre>

After that, you have a working checkout of the repository.

h3. Getting write access

A condition for write (push) access is that you agree that any code or data you push will be licensed under the General Public License, version 2, with or without the "or any later version" clause. In case the directory the changes apply to contains a LICENSE or COPYING file indicating another license, your pushed code has to be dual licensed appropriately. Subdirectories currently having a dual license:
* data/qcsrc/warpzonelib - dual licensed as "GPLv2 or later" or MIT license.
In case code you pushed was not written by you, it is your responsibility to ensure proper licensing.

To apply for write access, make an issue of type "Support" in the category "Repository" and attach your public SSH key to it.

To cleanly check out then, you would do:

<pre>
git clone ssh://xonotic@git.xonotic.org/xonotic.git
cd xonotic
./all update
</pre>

If you already have a checkout, you would do:

<pre>
git config remote.origin.url ssh://xonotic@git.xonotic.org/xonotic.git
./all update
</pre>

After that, you can write to the reposiotry using the usual git commands (commit, push).
