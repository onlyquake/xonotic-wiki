Autobuilds are nightly builds of the latest code. They have the latest features, bugfixes and assets but they could be less stable than regular releases.

If you "installed" Xonotic by downloading and unpacking the [zip](http://xonotic.org/download/), you can update a regular release to autobuild using the scripts located in `misc/tools/rsync-updater` (use `update-to-autobuild.bat` if you're one Windows, `update-to-autobuild.sh` on Linux and Mac). You can go back to the normal release using the `update-to-release` scripts.
