h1. Basic mapping in Radiant

h2. Layout of Radiant

Radiant has four sections by default. Let's examine those a bit more in depth.

Clockwise from left:

* 2D View - This area allows you to view the map straight on from a certain axis. This is useful for aligning things flush with walls or other surfaces and for finer movement/scaling control.

* 3D View - This is a basic render of approximately how your map will look. It does not render lighting or anything like that, but it does render the textures as you will see them in game.

* Texture View - This section will show you all available texture sets in the left side and the members of that texture set on the right.

* Console - This is a moderated version of the console output of radiant if run from a console. Generally, the output in your system's console will be more complete and verbose, particularly during compile time.
