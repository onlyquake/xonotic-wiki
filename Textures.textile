h1. Textures in Xonotic

There are 2 material systems in Xonotic that can work together

First is just based by texture name, it reads texture suffix

> texturename.tga
> > diffuse texture

> texturename_norm.tga
> > normal map
> > > Xonotic uses tangent space normal map with inverted Y channel (OpenGL style)

> > > you can put height map in normal maps alpha channel and it will be used when offset or relief mapping is on

> texturename_bump.tga
> > bump map
> > > normal map have higher priority and it will overwrite bump map

> > > its wise to convert your bump map to normal map, because that way you can have higher roughness since height of each bump map is limited by cvar

> texturename_gloss
> > specular, shininess strength
> > > it can use colour 
> texturename_glow
> > fullbright map or self-illumination map or Incadesence map or how know how else its called :)
> > > this textures specify areas that will always have 100% lighting, they will be very bright and will glow in the dark

> texturename_pants
> > primary colour 
> > > this one tells what part of texture will use custom colour

> > > make it grayscale and leave same area 100% black in diffuse texture

> texturename_shirt
> > secondary color

Second material system is simplified Quake 3â„¢ shader system 
the only difference is that you can use only 1 pass
