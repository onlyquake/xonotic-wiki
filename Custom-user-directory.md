Sometimes you want to have several different configurations of Xonotic or want to separate client and server configurations. Xonotic allows you to do that by adding `-userdir <directory>` command line argument. For example, to force Xonotic server to use `/home/user/Games/Xonotic/Server` directory use this:

    $ xonotic-linux64-dedicated -userdir /home/user/Games/Xonotic/Server
