Grappling Hook
==============
Overview
--------
The grappling hook fires a chain that will travel a long distance until it hits a solid surface. Once latched onto something, it will immediately swing you there. The hook adds an extra challenge to fighting matches, and it also makes both surprise ambushes and miraculous escapes possible. Additionally, areas with powerups or weapons that were previously unreachable are now up for grabs, making matches involving “[Strength](Powerups#strength)” and “[Shield](Powerups#shield)” powerups much more interesting.

Grappling Hook mutator
----------------------
This mutator gives all players an off-hand [Grappling Hook](Weapons#grappling-hook). “off-hand” means you can't and needn't to select the grappling hook as weapon. This means you can shoot your enemies with real guns while you use the grappling hook.

To fire, press the “hook” key (default: E).

[CVar](CVars): `g_grappling_hook`.

Grappling hook as normal weapon
-------------------------------

Players could also have the grappling hook as a selectable weapon (on-hand). This has a few more capabilities, but  using this will deplete [fuel](Items). Also, you must select the grappling hook to use it, it's not possible to fire a gun and using the grappling hook at the same time.

-   Grappling hook information:
    -   *Primary*: Fires the hook, latches onto a surface, pulls the player there, and then detaches. Press and hold the <FIRE> button to keep the hook attached for longer, but this depletes fuel quickly.
    -   *Secondary*: Drops a gravity bomb that affects enemy players and also releases light and smoke (similar to a flashbang).
    -   *Ammunition*: Regenerating fuel (Primary), [Cells](Weapons#cells) (Secondary).
-   Using the default keybinds, the Grappling Hook should should be in weapon **slot 0** (‘zero’).
-   The “hook” key will also work as a shortcut. In this case, this key selects the grappling hook and fires it.

Hints
-----
-   The Grappling Hook is *not* a hitscan beam! Depending on the distance, it may take a second or two for the hook to actually reach its destination, so use careful timing if using it for an escape!
-   Conserve your charge (on-hand grappling hook only). It may take a while to regenerate, so don’t consume it all at once.
