Clan Arena (CA)
===============

Object of the Game
------------------

Clan Arena is a round-based game mode which is played with teams. Each team spawns with almost all weapons. In each round, every player only has one life, once they die, they can only spectate. If one surviving team remains, they win the round and gain a point.

By the default rules, the first team to reach 10 points in total, or the first team to be 6 points in the lead, wins the match. (The score requirement can of course be changed.)

Clan Arena can be played with 2-4 teams.
