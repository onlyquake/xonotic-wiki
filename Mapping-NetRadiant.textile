h1. NetRadiant

h2. There is no way around it, lets just jump in and start with netradaint.

h3. This is Netradaint 

* Windows users, yours will be much uglier but should still have the same layout. 
* For linux users the look depends on the theme you chose. !! NOTE !! using a global (mac style) title bar may not work. consider yourself warned (unity users) !!
* Mac ... I have no idea...

h3. The 4 panes

Now, Netradaint has 4 main pains
# First there is the main top-down view. It will show the map's blueprint.
# Second there is the 3d view. It will show a realtime 3d preview of the map. However, it wont render lights, or any special effects.
# Third there is the texture pane. It should show a list of textures on the left side (if empty refer to previous page). It also should have a title bar on the top (for linux users who don't see one refer to second bullet point above.)  
# Finally at the bottom of the window is the console pane. All sorts of information will be piped through this pane.

note :: all of the panes can be resized by dragging on their borders. If you have issues with the current layout, it can always be changed by going to _edit-> prefrences_


h3. Navigational Controls 

Basic controls for the blueprint window involve 
* scroll wheel to zoom (shift rightclick also works)
* hold rightclick will move around the scene
* pressing number keys 1-9 will change the grid size (0 will hide/show the grid)


Basic controls for 3d view (although we havn't put anything in it yet, so its kinda boring)
* scroll wheel is zoom (ctrl + shift + rightclick also works)
* rightclick triggers look mode
* while in look mode move the mouse to look around and the mousewheel to fly around the 3d scene



thats it, no rank increase for this one
