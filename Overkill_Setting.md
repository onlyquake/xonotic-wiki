Overkill is a modification of Xonotic gameplay. See its [tutorial](Overkill_Tutorial) for details.

There is no exact agreed-upon balance yet (the one that ships with Xonotic is outdated and missing many features), so if you want to run a server, you should base it one one of the existing servers: [WTWRP](https://github.com/martin-t/xonotic-config/), [LX'](https://github.com/RomanSixty/xonotic-config), [SMB](https://github.com/MarioSMB/smb-servers/blob/master/configs/server-overkill.cfg). Ask on IRC if you want more details.

That's all there is to it! Happy overkilling!
