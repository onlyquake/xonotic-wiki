=================================================================

Object of the Game
------------------

In LMS you start with a special amount of lives (9 by default) and with every weapon (except [[Weapons|Mine Layer]]; [[Weapons|HLAC]]; [[Weapons|T.A.G. Seeker]]; [[Weapons|Fireball]]; [[Weapons|Grappling Hook]]; [[Weapons|Port-O-Launch]] and the [[Weapons|@\#!%’n Tuba]]). For each death you lose 1 live and once you run out of your lives you will have to spectate until the end of the map. The last one that survives is the “Last Man Standing” and wins the map.

- If you don’t move (e.g. camp or hide) you get hurt after a while and lose some health! So always keep moving.
