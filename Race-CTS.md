Race CTS (= Complete The Stage)
===============================

Object of the Game

CTS can use any phyics, but [XDF](XDF) is the default physics set, based on the [Quake DeFRaG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeFRaG) mod.

- *Shield* - Currently damage is off, this item does nothing
- *Armor* - Currently damage is off, this item does nothing. *Some exceptions apply*
- *Health* - Currently damage is off, this item does nothing. *Some exceptions apply*
- *Jet Pack* - This is used to fly
- *Decorative* - Some maps have entities you cannot, or should not pick up as they are just decorative

Weapons

Some maps use weapons.

- *Rocket Launcher* - Aim at the ground or walls, gain speed
- *Hagar* - Aim in front, towards your feet at a low angle, wall climb
- *Mortar* - Aim in front, towards your feet at a low angle, gain height
- *Crylink* - Aim behind, towards ground or wall, speed, distance
