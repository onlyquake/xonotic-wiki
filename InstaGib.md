InstaGib
========

Overview
--------

InstaGib replaces all weaponry with the [Vaporizer](Weapons#vaporizer). It is a powerful hitscan weapon that will immediately kill the target player in one shot (unless they got an extra life).

InstaGib is a popular mutator that mixes well with almost all game modes and may be included in many Xonotic servers. When participating in an InstaGib match, one must have particularly good aim and conserve shots whenever possible. Because if you run out of ammo for 10 seconds, you will die

Rules
-----

* Vaporizer:
    * Everyone gets the Vaporizer with 10 cells
    * The Vaporizer consumes 1 cell per shot
    * A dropped Vaporizer weapon gives you 10 cells
    * The cells [item](Items) only gives you 5 cells
    * If you don't have ammo for 10 seconds, you die and might lose a point due to suicide
    * The secondary fire of the Vaporizer doesn't deal damage
* Items and powerup replacements:
    * Strength [powerup](Powerups) is replaced by Invisibility
    * Shield powerup is replaced by Speed
    * [Mega Health](Items) is replaced by Extra Life
* New items and powerups:
    * Invisibility: Makes you (nearly) invisible for 30 seconds
    * Speed: Greatly increases your movement for 30 seconds
    * Extra Life: Grants you one or more extra lives (amount depends on settings). Extra lives act like armor, when you got hit with an extra life left, you will survive the shot

Hints
---------------
* Cells ammunition may be difficult to find on some maps, but can be picked up readily from a downed player.
