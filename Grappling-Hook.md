Grappling Hook mutator
======================
The “**Grappling Hook**” mutator gives all players an off-hand [Grappling Hook](Weapons#grappling-hook). Players can use the grappling hook to move around and still frag their opponents at the same time!

The grappling hook fires a chain that attaches to surfaces and drags you towards it. To fire, press the “hook” key (default: E).

Details
-------
A detailed description of the grappling hook is given [here](Weapons#grappling-hook), but in this mutator, the grappling hook behaves differently:

* You have infinite shots (no fuel required)
* The grappling hook is off-hand, you can't and needn't select it as a weapon
* The secondary fire is not available

CVars
-----
Use the [CVar](CVars) `g_grappling_hook` to enable this mutator.
