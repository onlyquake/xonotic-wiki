Object of the Game
------------------

In **Onslaught** there are usually 2 teams, each controlling a generator. The goal is to destroy the opponent's generator. Across the map are several control points, which are connected to each other and to the generator. One may only capture a control point or attack a generator if they control another conneccted control point. So the teams need to conquer the control points first.

The team that manages to destroy the opponent's generator wins the match.

Gameplay
--------

### Control points
Control points are interconnected to each others and the generators. The minimap shows the connections. Players of each team must capture control points to advance through a network of control points, eventually reaching the enemy generator.

A neutral control point is captured by walking into it. This will take a bit of construction time, but the contruction cannot be halted. Only control points that are connected to your generator or to a control point that you own can be captured.

A control point that a team owns can be destroyed and turned neutral by attacking the “infobot” above. When the “infobot” is destroyed, the control point is neutral again and can be captured.

### Generator
The opponent's generator can be attacked if you own a neighboring control point. Otherwise, the generator is shielded from attacks. If the shield is down, attack the generator with all your might to destroy it and win the match. 

### Teleportation
Control points and the generator are also used as spawn and teleportation points.

When you're dead, the game allows you to select a new spawn point.

When you're in front of your generator or one of your control points, you can press [F] to select a destination to teleport you. Teleportation has a cooldown of 5 seconds, however.

### Overtime

After a certain period (usually 4 minutes and 40 seconds), overtime will start and the generators will decay. The rate at which this occurs depends on how many control points your team controls. The more control points you have, the faster the opponent's generator will decay.

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

*  If your generator has lost any health, a waypoint for it will appear including its health. Likewise, all control points your team controls which have lost health also have waypoints showing their health. Make sure to defend your control points and generator.
*  All control points available for capture have waypoints that include their health (if captured).
*  If someone is camping near one of your control points or one you are attacking, you can slow them down using the Blaster.
