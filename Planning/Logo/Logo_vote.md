MirceaKitsune:

(and Morphed’s video as game intro)  

Samual  
\#1: Dokujisans \#27 or \#28 http://www.nullgaming.com/stuff/x/xonotic_logo_idea25.jpg (Also using the center piece as the icon for the game)  
\#2: -z-’s logo, although i’m not sure how well we can make it into an icon.  
\#3: Morphed’s main logo http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/3679/xonoticlogo13.jpg (I like this quite a bit, but I don’t like how overpowering the red is in it.)  

As for intro video, morphed’s needs 2 things: \#1: The effects could be worked on and improved greatly.. It’s (No offense) rather poor quality at the moment. Although it would be fine at first, I think our goal is for something smoother and more polished than that \#2: It needs to be 16:9 aspect ratio.

Rad_Ished  
1. Doku \#28  

divVerent  
1. Dokujisan \#14  
2. Taoki logo_idea_8 or logo_idea_10 or logo_idea_11  
3. Dokujisan \#28  
(4. Morphed xonotic-mp4)  

-z-’s logos: I like all the phoenixes, but none of the finished logos - the font simply does not work, I read it “xontic”.  
Dokujisan’s logos: the ones with X in the logo are unacceptable, as it reads “xonxtic” then.  
Morphed: the fire effect is just too much for a good logo - logos should be simple to remember and easy to “draw similarily”  

Hew:  
Doku \#28  
Doku \#26  
MirceaKitsune red nodetail  

bones_was_here  
1. Doku \#28  
2. MirceaKitsune red nodetail  

Xeno:  
Dokujisan \#28  
(sorry but it’s the only one I really like, so the only one that I’me voting for)  

esteel:  
- Z’s 1b  
- MirceaKitsune’s idea_8  
- Docu’s 23  
Also wanna not that the logos should have no special handling of the middle “O” excpet for size maybe.. with an different color then the rest of the name the O tends to not be noticed as a letter but just as goodie for the phoenix..
