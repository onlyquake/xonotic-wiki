Core Weapons
============
These are the main weapons of Xonotic. They are used either as starter weapons or can be collected in most official maps.

The Blaster is the weakest weapon and one of the starter weapons. It does not use any ammo and it's shot is rather weak, but the strong pushback force can be used to knock enemies to their doom.

- Primary attack: Fire a weak blaster shot that deals little damage, but has a strong pushback.
- Secondary fire: Switch to previously selected weapon
- Ammo: None
- Impulse: 1/230
- Also known as: Laser

Shotgun
-------

This is another weapon that players start with in most game modes. The shotgun is most effective in short range battles.

New Toys
========
These are weapons that the [New Toys](New Toys) mutator introduces. But you might also be able to find them in some maps.

Mine Layer
----------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/uwt4dre6rvjxuxbfcdis.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/pl2srlpok02x8zu8kfe.jpg)

- Secondary fire: Detonate all mines immediately.
- Ammo: Rockets
- Impulse: 4/234

Hint: Use the Mine Layer to protect isolated areas of the map, particularly important areas such as those that contain weapons, [powerups](Powerups), control points in [Onslaught](Onslaught), flags in [CTF](Capture-the-Flag), and checkpoints in [Assault](Assault).

Heavy Laser Assault Cannon (HLAC)
---------------------------------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/oqcqslhrebsuwamcbsr2.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/d1ndvcydn97atrdjkrcg.jpg)

- Secondary: Fire a single, broadly scattered shot.
- Ammo: Cells
- Impulse: 6/243

Rifle
------------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/9kulqb3339ido0x9eqxx.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/ssg6hdtu38jn9yetz2.jpg)

The rifle is the strongest sniper weapon that is not a super weapon. It has a limited magazine capacity and needs reloading. You can reload manually with the Reload key (default: R).

T.A.G. Seeker
-------------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/uo9n5c224ws1e91c49d4.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/ckh0mg30by9deb9th46v.jpg)

The T.A.G. Seeker is a very powerful weapon that fires homing missiles, but it needs some skill to use effectively. It usually does at least 80 damage before an enemy can escape it, sometimes more, often killing the enemy very quickly.

- Primary fire: Fire a particle called a “tag”. If that particle hits, one may continue to hold down the primary fire button to launch homing explosives as long as the target is in sight, dealing 20-40 damage with each hit.
- Secondary: Launch a rapid barrage of explosives with a short range.
- Ammo: Rockets
- Impulse: 8/247

Super weapons
=============
Super weapons are the deadliest weapons in Xonotic. When you pick up a super weapon under normal conditions, you will only be allowed to hold it for 30 seconds. After this, it will disappear.

Vaporizer
---------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/8praunzsu37vutllk55.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/vld5zxiwuys46zpygvo.jpg)

The Vaporizer is a super weapon and the strongest sniper weapon in the game. It is capable of one-shot kills.

-   Primary fire: Fire the deadly beam. Kills with one shot, unless the target got an extra life (see [InstaGib](InstaGib)). Costs 1 cell.
-   Secondary fire: Fire a blaster-like projectile with a very strong pushback. Very useful to move yourself around in the map.
-   Ammo: Cells
-   Impulse: 7/241
-   Also known as: MinstaNex

In [InstaGib](InstaGib), every players gets the Vaporizer for free and without time limit.

Fireball
--------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/v1mtkb5tqkg78y5x5zak.png) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/b9rz84cu63ph0vdr5x67.jpg)

Fireball is a very explosive super weapon.

- Primary fire: Launch a large ball of fire that will fly in a straight line detonate in a huge explosion. The shot has a delay of ca. 1 second, however.
- Secondary fire: Throw fire mines that hurt anyone nearby. You can throw them with a delay of ca. 3 seconds each.
- Ammo: Fuel
- Impulse: 9/246

Tools
=====

Grappling Hook
--------------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/ndc9ijmd4hntegvy3hk.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/by8v66xilbih4mj7l9k.jpg)

NOTE: The grappling hook is usually added via the [Grappling Hook mutator](Grappling Hook), which gives it to players off-hand. But the grappling hook can also be used as selectable “weapon”. This section describes how the grappling hook works by default (i.e. without the mutator).

The grappling hook fires a chain that will travel a long distance until it hits a solid surface. Once latched onto something, it will immediately swing you there. The hook adds an extra challenge to fighting matches, and it also makes both surprise ambushes and miraculous escapes possible. Additionally, areas with powerups or weapons that were previously unreachable are now up for grabs.

The grappling hook needs fuel to work (unless the [Grappling Hook mutator](Grappling Hook) is active).

- Primary fire: Fires the hook, latches onto a surface, pulls the player there, and then detaches. Press and hold the <FIRE> button to keep the hook attached for longer, but this depletes fuel quickly.
- Secondary fire: Drops a gravity bomb that affects enemy players and also releases light and smoke (similar to a flashbang). Not possible if the [Grappling Hook mutator](Grappling Hook) is active.
- Ammo: Fuel (or nothing when [Grappling Hook mutator](Grappling Hook) is active)
- Impulse: 14/242

Hints and notes:
-   The “hook” key (default: E) works as a shortcut for primary fire. In this case, this key selects the grappling hook and fires it.
-   The grappling hook is *not* a hitscan beam! Depending on the distance, it may take a second or two for the hook to actually reach its destination, so use careful timing if using it for an escape!
-   Conserve your charge (on-hand grappling hook only). It may take a while to regenerate, so don’t consume it all at once.

Port-O-Launch
-------------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/ut32h62fxw63gw1pqcn.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/6920poan8rfljg4k8t0w.jpg)

Port-O-Launch creates one-way portals that teleport players. Primary and secondary fire launch “portal balls” that will create portals when they hit a flat surface. Portal balls will be repelled by some surfaces.

You need two portals for this to work: An in-portal (red) and an out-portal (blue). When you have created both portals, any player that enters the in-portal gets teleported to the out-portal. The out-portal will not teleport players back.

Portals stay open only for a limited amount of time (default 15 seconds). Both portals also close when the player that created the portals has died.

-   Primary fire: Fire the portal entrance (red).
-   Secondary fire: Fire the portal exit (blue).
-   Ammo: None
-   Impulse: 14/240

Ball Stealer
------------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/ut32h62fxw63gw1pqcn.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/6920poan8rfljg4k8t0w.jpg)

The Ball Stealer is a special tool used in [Nexball](Nexball) games. It is used to carry the ball and steal it from others. When you collect the ball, you will automatically equip the Ball Stealer and are unable to equip anything else.

The Ball Stealer currently looks identical to the Port-O-Launch.

- Primary fire: Throw ball. Hold pressed to throw stronger.
- Secondary fire: Try to steal ball from opponent
- Ammo: None
- Impulse: ???

Silly and experimental weapons
==============================

@\#!%'n Tuba
------------

![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/lhd46626ynelcxxe0ydt.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/sxsmwgh7plcv7ivuacx.jpg)

The @\#!%'n tuba is a very silly and @\#!%'n annoying weapon that makes the ears of your enemies bleed!

If you hold down the @\#!%'n attack key, you will play the @\#!%'n tuba. The pitch of the sound will vary while pressing different directional keys or the @\#!%'n Jump key while make some noise.

Using it as weapon can be @\#!%'n challenging, as it obscures a large portion of your sight.

- @\#!%'n primary fire: Play the @\#!%'n tuba and deal low but rapid short-range damage to whoever the @\#!% you're facing.
- @\#!%'n secondary fire: Same as @\#!%'n primary fire, but with higher pitch.
- Ammo: None
- Impulse: 1/244

Shockwave
----------
![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/enzsrkxcf9mmbtp15437.jpg) ![](http://pics.nexuizninjaz.com/images/wp0dmhpu9wr3dv75men.jpg)

This weapon is experimental. It fires shockwave blasts and does not need ammo. It currently looks identical to the shotgun.

-   Primary fire: Fire a shockwave blast that deals short-range damage.
-   Secondary fire: Slap your opponents (same a shotgun).
-   Ammo: None
-   Impulse: 2/248
