GuideIndex
==========

this is a temporary page to brainstorm the structure of a Xonotic Userguide
once the structure is set up, this shall be deleted

Pages should be prefixed with “Guide” (or come up with something better) to prevent namespace clashes with existing developer pages,
and to differentiate them from developer resources in the wiki index.

**Please help refine or rework this structure before we go on to create the actual pages**
