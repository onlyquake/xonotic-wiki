h1. Community development

{{>toc}}

Dokujisan is forming a group called the XCT or Xonotic Community Team
This will be made up of a group of select people from each regional community (North america, Europe, Australia.

The purpose of XCT is to help plan and execute tasks related to community activity, such as building up clan activity and managing tournaments.

Dokujisan is the community director of Xonotic and his main role is to help establish the organization of community activities.
The activity that stems from the efforts of XCT won't be based on Dokujisan's decisions alone. The planning will be done in a group fashion.
Of course, the activities decide by those in XCT need to be okay with the rest of *Team Xonotic*.

So far, we have the following XCT members. These groups will group and change overtime.
