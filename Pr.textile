h1. Public Relations

Our first announcement of this project is coming immediately after illfonic first announces their Nexuiz game at GDC http://www.gdconf.com
Their announcement could happen anytime during that conference, which is held March 9th - 13th.

Here, we will organize the ideas behind our first project announcement.

The main goal for this introductory announcement is to state *1) our reasons* and *2) our plans*, but we will focus more on our plans. This announcement shouldn't focus on finger-pointing. Rather, it should focus on our own values and the goals that we plan to accomplish with this new game. We will have to touch upon the *broken trust* that stemmed from decisions made behind closed doors. But our main goal for this announcement is to make our intentions clear, and, of course, to unveil the new name. We want to begin filling up our IRC channels and our website.

h1. Our announcement

(Here is where the announcement copy will start)

We'd like to formally announce the beginnings of our new community project, Xonotic.  The founders of this project and community were first Nexuiz[link] developers, contributors and believers.  Following the March 1st announcement of IllFonic's aquiring of nexuiz.com and the rights to the name for their closed source PS3 version of Nexuiz, a large portion of the community has joined together to create Xonotic.  Beyond being a first person shooter based on Nexuiz (GPL) 2.5.2svn[link], Xonotic aims to be a rethink and reorganization of how we share a GPL video game and organize the services around it.
