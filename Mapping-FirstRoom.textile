h1. Mapping-FirstRoom

There are three types of xonotic maps.

* Indoor  (stormkeep)
* Outdoor (space elevator)
* Kinda both (solarium)

In this tutorial we will begin creating and indoor map. The map will contain various sized rooms connected to each other, in the same way stormkeep is put together. Now, we have to start somewhere, so lets begin with the first room.

This is what radiant should look like when started up (putting aside minor theme differences and such). Before we begin we need to set a grid size, to do this simply hit one of the number keys along the top of your keyboard.

A small demonstration of grids. You can change the grid size anytime you wish, however, *DO NOT set it to the smallest size* pick something big, and go smaller only when you need to. I will be using grid size 7.

Click on a point on the grid, and drag to make a square.

Done.
