They are constantly moving side to side (except when attacking), and so manage to dodge many incoming slow-moving projectiles. Also, if you duck behind cover while they are attacking, they may throw an extra shot or two at your last seen location, so you might want to be careful before you pop back out again.

Vore is a three-legged monster that moves very slowly, but throws spiked bombs that home in on the player's position, making them often one of the trickiest enemies to deal with, especially in combination with other enemies.
The homing firepods (more commonly known as Voreballs or Vorespikes) that are thrown by the vore can follow the player around quite sharp corners when close enough, and do not explode until they collide with something.
