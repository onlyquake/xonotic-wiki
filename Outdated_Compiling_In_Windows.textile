h1. Compiling in Windows

{{>toc}}

*NOTE*: there is an experimental automated building pack for Windows that uses a portable version of the tools mentioned in this article.
If you are planning on contributing to the project, it is best to follow the tutorial. If you are just interested in running and testing the game, you can find the build system "here":http://forums.xonotic.org/showthread.php?tid=666.


*This guide will be back before August 12, I removed it because it won't compile Xonotic properly anymore (wget and unzip are not present in msys-core, which cause the map download to fail)
If you still want to read the guide, get the previous version in the article history*
