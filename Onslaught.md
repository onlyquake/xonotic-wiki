Object of the Game
------------------

_(Insert object of the game here)_
In Onslaught there are usually 2 teams, each controlling a generator. Across the map are several control points, which are connected to each other and to the generator. One may only capture a control point or attack a generator if they control another conneccted control point.

After a certain period(usually 4 minutes and 40 seconds) overtime will start and the generators will decay. The rate at which this occurs depends on how many control points your team controls.

How to:
*  Capture a neutral control point? Walk to it.
*  Capture an enemy's control point? Attack the "infobot" above the control point to destroy it and make the point neutral. Then you can walk to it.
*  Destroy the generator? Simply attack it to reduce its health.

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

*  If your generator has lost any health, a waypoint for it will appear including its health. Likewise, all control points your team controls which have lost health also have waypoints showing their health. Make sure to defend your control points and generator.
*  All control points available for capture have waypoints that include their health (if captured).
*  If someone is camping near one of your control points or one you are attacking, you can slow them down using the Blaster.
