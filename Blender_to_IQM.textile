> > h3. Before You Start
> > > * use the bbox.blend in order to see the size that your model should be. Iqm exporter scale function untested.
> > > * use the duck_bbox.blend in order to see the size that your model should be when crouching.
> > > * for more information on bbox size refer to div0's model specs [[Player_Model_Spec]]
> > > * naming conventions for textures and model go as follow assuming the example is the umbra model: modelname: umbra.iqm, framegroups: umbra.iqm.framegroups, textures: umbra.tga or (jpg), umbra_norm.tga, umbra_gloss.tga,  (need to add more)
> > h3. Before exporting
> > > * you must assign material to your model. Select your model in object mode. Press F5. Look for the MA box and type the name of your model for example umbra.
> > h3.  Exporting
> > > # Select both mesh and armature in object mode. 
> > > # Go to scripts > export > inter-quake-model. 
> > > # Now make sure bounding boxes and meshes are both highlighted in the script window. 
> > > # Export to a file path of your choosing, /path/to/umbra.iqm. Put the names of all the animations in the animations box, using commas for multiple anims. Then hit the export button and hopefully it will work without any errors.
