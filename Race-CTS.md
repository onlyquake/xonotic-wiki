Race CTS (= Complete The Stage)
===============================

Object of the Game
------------------

In **Race CTS** (=Complete The Stage), the map is a race track and you have to run through the map from start to finish as fast as possible possible. It's a variant of [Race](Race). Difference here is that you don't run in laps and the start and finish points are at different positions.

Gameplay
--------
The map will have a start point, checkpoints and a finish point. To *complete the stage*, you start at the start point and run to each checkpoint in the correct order until you reach the finish point. The HUD will show you where you have to run next. In some maps, there can be branching paths and multiple checkpoints will be shown. In this case, you can choose which path to take.

When you've reached the finish point, your time is recorded. You will respawn shortly afterwards, for another attempt to complete the stage as fast as you can.

Your goal is to get the fastest time.

Unlike in [Race](Race), damage is normally disabled in Race CTS.
