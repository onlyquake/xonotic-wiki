# Overview
This mutator replaces the Arc/Machine Gun, Vortex, Hagar, and Devastator with new, more gimmicky weapons, specifically the Heavy Layer Assault Cannon, Rifle, TAG Seeker and Mine Layer respectively. These weapons normally replace their counterparts about 50% of the time and may have dedicated spawns on some maps (such as techassault)
# Mutator Details
-  Heavy Layer Assault Cannon information:
   -  *Primary:* Rapidly fire laser particles, dealing a small amount of knockback and 10-13 damage.
   -  *Secondary:* Fire a single, broadly scattered shot.
   -  *Ammunition:* Cells
-  Rifle information:
   -  *Primary:* Fire a shot which pierces through walls, dealing 80-90 damage to an enemy hit, for 10 ammo.
   -  *Secondary:* Fire a faster, somewhat scattered shot.
   -  *Ammunition:* Bullets (magazine size 80)
-  TAG Seeker information:
   - *Primary:* Fire a particle called a "tag." If that particle hits, one may continue to hold down the primary fire button to launch homing explosives as long as the target is in sight, dealing 20-40 damage with each hit.
   - *Secondary:* Launch a rapid barrage of explosives.
-  Mine Layer information:
   - *Primary:* Place mines on the ground, which deal 20-40 damage if stepped on by an enemy. These persist for 10 seconds before exploding. Up to three mines may be placed at a time.
   - *Secondary:* Detonate all mines immediately.
-  Use the Mine Layer to protect isolated areas of the map, particularly important areas such as those that contain weapons, powerups, control points in Onslaught, flags in CTF, and checkpoints in Assault.
-  The TAG Seeker and Rifle are very powerful weapons. The Rifle is likely the best "sniper" item in the game, and the TAG Seeker usually does at least 80 damage before an enemy can escape it, sometimes more, often killing the enemy very quickly.
