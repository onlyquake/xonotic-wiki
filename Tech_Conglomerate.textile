h1. Tech Conglomerate
Date: Future
Region: Milky Way Galaxy (?)

h2. Story outline

* Massive business conglomerate(s) that manufactures arms, vehicles, ammo
** Could be several or could be one
** Supply/finance intragalactic warfare (constant struggle kept up)
** If several, they could all specialize and deal to all factions or make the same things and deal to everyone (they are allied in secret, support different factions)
*** If they specialize, factions possibly arms from all corporations, thinking they are tricking them, yet all corporations knowingly sell to the same factions
*** Split could be based on type of wares (guns, vehicles) or types of guns (ammo types, and a separate company for vehicles) 
** Logos present on ammo, gun, vehicle models (playermodels have faction emblems)
** Sole weapon manufacturer(s) in the galaxy
*** Owns entire planets dedicated to manufacturing and deploying arms
*** When a faction attempts to break free and manufacture arms, the company engages a kill switch in those faction's arms and/or bombs their factories (with raptors) (galactic space mafia)

* Intragalactic war
** Neverending
** Involves several (likely four?) factions
** Going on for ages
** Whenever faction tries to make peace, business conglomerate puts them in line (batch of faulty weapons, etc.)

h2. Player's role

Both campaigns could be included, could be billed as "separate timelines" or something of the sort.

h3. Underdog

* Player is  member of resistance movement which has stolen lots of equipment and formed an attack team
** Fights through several campaigns to bring down each company individually (or just one if one company)
** If each company specializes, they use whatever they specialize in extensively
** Taking place on company controlled planets/important communication/manufacturing centers?

h3. Oppressor

* Player is a member of a team formed to extinguish all resistance movements
** Access to lots of arms and ammo and vehicles (for open maps)
** Given a serial number (randomly generated?) and a clean model (Erebus/Nyx?)
** Fights resistance in contested planets/factories/communication centers
** Player's squadron is shared between the companies and employed wherever resistance crops up
*** If companies specialize, player is equipped with whatever the company specializes first and foremost (however, they may take weapons from downed resistance members)

h2. Multiplayer explanation

* Multiplayer is a combat simulator
** Don't necessarily need to explain if the company or resistance operates the simulator
** Easily explains respawning, etc.

h2. Factions

* Factions do not particularly matter as they do not necessarily have to figure in the campaign
** Could be brutes employed by the corporation(s) to stop the player in the "Underdog" campaign
*** As player progresses in the campaign, they see less of the factional player models (everyone else) and more company player models (erebus/nyx?)
** However, player could also specify factional allegiance (resistance is a "pacifist" movement, so factions put aside differences)
** Not sure how they can figure in the "Oppressor" campaign (redshirts killed quickly in the beginning of some battles?)
* Factions may be adopted from the [[Close to Home]] scenario or invented anew
** Only difference between factions is player models
