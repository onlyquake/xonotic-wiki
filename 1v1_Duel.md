Object of the Game
------------------

Deathmatch is one of the most popular (and easiest) gamemodes in Xonotic. It is a simple free for all fight where everyone plays versus everyone. Each frag (-\> kill) awards you 1 point. To win a map you need 30 points. Note: You lose 1 point if you suicide (e.g. fall in space, lava or kill yourself with a weapon).
