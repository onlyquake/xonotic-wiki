h1. Organizational Structure

This organizational structure of this project is based on distributed power to avoid any single person making a decision without consulting the community.  Major decisions will be made by the 3-6 appointed leaders who have expertise in a specific area of the game but can also discuss all areas of the game/community.  Below the leaders serves a committee who exist to act as a liaison to project leaders on specific areas to make sure the leaders are getting the fullest picture they can.

Please bare with us while we continue to define the team and review nominees.
