Powerups
========

Powerups spawn from time to time in the arena and grant to whoever collects them a temporary super power. They usually appear at about every 2 minutes or so.

A powerup usually lasts for 30 seconds. Powerups will also be shown in the radar and the HUD 10 seconds before they appear.

With the Shield you only take 33% of the damage you would normally receive. You're also more resistant to push forces.

Strength

Strength increases the damage you deal by a factor of 3. The force/knockback that attacks cause is also greatly increased.

The damage and knockback you can deal to yourself is only increased by a factor of 1.5.
