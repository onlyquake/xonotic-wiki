Translations are managed via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/team-xonotic/xonotic/dashboard/).

Create an account on Transifex and send a request to join a language team. Once your request has been approved, you can submit suggestions or translations directly through the Transifex interface, or by editing the PO file with an external editor, such as [poedit](https://poedit.net/) (Transifex allows you to download and upload PO files).

Translations are automatically synced (once a day) between Transifex and the [xonotic-data.pk3dir](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic-data.pk3dir) git repository.
