Team Deathmatch (TDM)
=====================

Object of the Game
------------------

The gameplay of Team Deathmatch (TDM) is very similar to [Deathmatch (DM)](Deathmatch), but the players are divided into two teams (Red and Blue) and are pitted against each other. Here, teammates may need to communicate with one another to ensure victory.

Scoring
-------

| Action | Score |
|:-:|:-:|
| Kill an opponent | +1 |
| Kill yourself | -1 |
| Kill team mate | -1 |

Killing an opponent is also know as a “frag”.

By the default rules, the team that collectively scores 50 points first wins the match.

Map Entities
------------

-   **Weapons** - These can be picked up from various places around the map or from a downed player.
-   **Ammo** - These may be found in the form of shells, bullets, rockets, jet fuel, or power cells.
-   **Powerups** - All maps have “Health” and “Armor” powerups, which extend your lifetime. Some maps may contain 
powerups like “[Strength](Powerups#strength)” or “[Shield](Powerups#shield)” (which usually spawn every 2 minutes).

Helpful Hints and Tips
----------------------

-   Always keep moving. This can be especially true for smaller maps and/or very crowded matches. If you stay in one place for too long, you risk becoming an easy target.
-   If your map contains powerups such as the ones mentioned above, make good use of them. They can be useful tools to win a match!
-   Keep your suicides at a minimum. Your point counter *can* enter into the negatives, so always avoid self-injury.
-   Using team [binds](binds) like “Enemy seen” are useful here and can be used to alert teammates of an enemy presence.
