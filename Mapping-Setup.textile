h1. Mapping-Setup

h2. How to get your system all set up to start mapping ^^

h3. Step 1

Wait for the mapping support download I linked to in the intro to finish downloading

... >.< this one http://dl.xonotic.org/xonotic-0.6.0-mappingsupport.zip

h3. Step 2

Un extract the .zip archive using your favorite archiving tool ... this could be 
* winrar
* ark 
* on a mac you just open it like a folder 
* any other tool that reads .zip files

h3. Step 3

Locate your .xonotic folder ... this step can be a little confusing ...

With xonotic there are 2 locations the game looks to find data ... 
   there is the folder that the xonotic program sits in ... this is called the _install location_
       this is located ... wherever you put it ... if you dont know ... try a search

   there is also the personal/hidden xonotic folder ... its called the _personal location_
       on linux this should be in ~/.xonotic 
       on windows (7) its in ~/saved games ... or something like that
       on mac ... its in ~/libraries/appdata ?? maybe ??
