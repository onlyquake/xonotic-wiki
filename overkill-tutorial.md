Overkill Tutorial
=================

*Work-in-progress*

Overkill is a Xonotic mod characterized by

- fast movement,
- fewer but more powerful weapons,
- nades and
- respawning near team mates.

To excel at overkill there is two things to practice: aim and speed. If you're feeling old or your reflexes aren't that good, don't despair: Speed is the more important of the two.


Weapons
=======

Basic Weapons
-------------

Every player has the same three weapons. You don't have to collect them and you also have infinite ammo.

- Vortex (Long distance, very precise)
this is the main weapon, it hit's what it's aimed at
- Shotgun (point blank weapon with large spread)
this deals quite a lot of damage in short range, but has a large spread rendering it mostly useless for a distance
it can however be used to slow down approaching enemies
- Machine Gun (mid-range weapon with a bit of spread)
the spread increases gradually, so it's best to shoot salvoes in quick succession instead of keeping the trigger pulled
also slows enemies down

Super Weapons
-------------

Those weapons have to be picked up and are only available on some maps.
 
- Heavy Machine Gun
this is basically the machine gun - only it's bigger, faster, has a larger ammo capacity and is even more powerful
point at general direction of enemy, pull the trigger, enemy dead
- Rocket Propelled Chainsaw Launcher
this sounds more fun than it actually is, basically it's a rocket launcher
slow rockets, huge damage, quite a damage radius
you'll have a hard time not killing yourself with it, so you better jump around while using it and not aim at walls next to you

Nades
-----

Nade is the shorthand term for *grenade*. It deals quite a lot of damage and also has a big damage radius.

You can release a nade every few seconds by pressing the `drop weapon` bind (per default that's the `g` key). After that a countdown starts until the nade explodes. You have to press the same key again to throw the nade in the direction you're looking at.

To excel at nading here are a few tips:

* Keep the nade until short before the explosion and throw it into an enemy. That way it won't bounce away and the enemy has no way to dodge it.
* You can use nades kind of like a mine by dropping it on the floor at a place where an enemy will very likely be in a few moments (e.g. the flag spot in a CTF match). You can easily drop a nade by crouching before releasing it.
* You can use nades like a rocket launcher by throwing them in front of you and then shooting it with the vortex. This propels the nade very far and causes very high damage with a bit of spread. It takes a little practice but is worth the effort.
* Also keep in mind nades bounce off walls and fall down stairs. It even deals damage through walls.


Movement
========

Every [vanilla movement tip](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#movement) also applies in Overkill. However there is one key aspect making the game way faster: wall-dodging.

Bunny Hopping
-------------

[Same as vanilla](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#bunny-hopping) - instead of just walking around you should jump because it's much faster. Basically **press the `jump` key all the time** (by default `space bar`). The only exceptions to this rule are if you *want* to be slow or you need to sneak. The turning and strafing tips also apply: hold `forward` to move straight, release `forward` and press `left` or `right` while moving the mouse slow but steadily in that direction to turn.

Laser / Blaster
---------------

All weapons in Overkill have the same secondary fire - laser (sometimes called blaster). It pushes the player using it (and also flags and nades), but unlike in vanilla it doesn't deal any damage. So blast away, literally.

Its main uses are:

- jumping higher - just aim at the floor and shoot
- climbing walls (no matter how high) - keep shooting the laser at roughly 45Â° down against a wall
- accelerating - shoot the floor or wall [slightly behind you](Halogenes_Newbie_Corner#wall-blastering) for a noticeable boost.

Wall-Dodging
------------

Dodging is somewhat specific to Overkill. Most people notice that quickly pressing the movement key in one direction twice dodges in that direction. This can be used to quickly gain a little tempo by pressing `forward` twice when starting to bunnyhop.

However dodging doesn't only apply to start moving but can be used on (more or less) even surfaces next to you. For example you can bunnyhop alongside a wall and press the `forward` key in quick succession to gain even more speed. You can do this multiple times with only a short cooldown time. Good maps to try this out are *Tarx* and *Equinox*.

You can reach very high speeds using wall dodging. The fastest way to accelerate is a combination of both wall-dodging and blastering. This has to be timed well to gain the most acceleration.

Advanced - Nade Jumping
-----------------------

Desperate situations call for desperate measures. Sometimes you need to get away *really* fast. One way to do that is to let a nade explode in your hand. This can be done by either facing in the opposite direction of where you want to be hurled or by being in a jump when the nade explodes.

Since a nade does about 160 damage you need additional armor or health for this trick, otherwise you'd just commit suicide.

Items
=====

- Health - 100
- Armor comes in sizes of 100, 50, 25
- Shards from dead enemies (5 armor) - most important on maps without other pickups

There's not much to say here except take everything you get. If you think there's no reason to pick them up because you'll die quickly anyway, you're wrong. Remember without any pickups a single vortex hit will instantly kill you. Even that 5 armor shard will keep you alive and win you time to shoot back or get in cover. A fully equipped player (max health at 200 and max armor at 100) will sustain three vortex hits. If the hits don't come in quick succession even four, because you're healing shortly after being hit.
