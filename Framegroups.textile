h1. .framegroups

This file is needed to make md3 or dpm model play some animations in Xonotic


you name it <modelname.extension>.framegroups

for model dog.dpm you will name it dog.dpm.framegroups

inside you have definitions of animations
each line is one animation

syntax:
<start frame> <frame count> <fps> <loop/noloop>

for example 
1 100 30 1 
means 100 frame animation that start at frame 1, plays at 30 frames per second and it loops for ever :)

if you make 1 looping animation and place model on map as misc_gamemodel it will be animated

for coders:
to play such self playing animation you just use self.frame=1 to play 1st animation, self.frame=2 to play 2nd animation, etc
if its not looping it will just stop at last frame and stay there until you run other animation
