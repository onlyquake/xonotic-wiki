h3. Opening cutscene (1/2)

_We see a space station, which appears to be a peaceful trading post. We see space traffic flowing through the various docks and ports. The camera pans around the station slowly, with no real pattern, just showing the normal day-to-day activities going on as usual._

_The view cuts to a view of the interior the cockpit a ship docked on the side of the station. We see the crew moving around. It is a cargo freighter and lightly manned._ 

_The captain is on the radio, communicating with the station’s dock staff. We hear a lot of chatter. Nothing important is said._

_Through the viewport of the freighter, we see a flash in the distance, somewhere in space, like a muzzle flash on a massive gun, or a star exploding. A few crew members notice it and look up. Some continue their work after a second, but two or three continue to peer out the viewport in the direction of the strange flash. After a few more seconds, a massive energy beam/laser comes into view from the direction of the flash and strikes the dock the ship is attached to, destroying it in a massive explosion and crippling the ship. The front of the ship begins to detach from the station and sink into the blackness of space (it’s actually just floating, since this is space, but the sinking feel will help add some emotion to the setting). The crew is frantically scrambling. The captain is loudly calling for help on the radio but the dock authorities cannot hear him (because they are all dead or dying)._

_The camera switches back to the exterior view. The front of the ship detaches from the dock completely and the rear dock begins to bend as the ship pulls away from the station, moving downward as if sinking. More lasers are seen impacting the station.The camera returns to the interior of the cockpit. The situation is becoming very intense inside. Suddenly, part of the dock snaps, the ship lurches forward, the begins to turn toward the side of the space station. Some of the crew members stop moving and simply give up hope. The rest work even more frantically. Everyone is yelling out different commands and ideas. Everyone braces for impact. The ship collides with the side of the station. The crew screams. A fireball engulfs the cockpit and the camera, serving as the transition to the next scene as it clears. The screams of the crew continue, fading out as the next scene begins._

h3. Opening cutscene (2/2)

_We see a massive expanse of open space. The title logo appears on the screen. The camera pans down and a planet comes into view. It is Micarais the planet where the Pacifist’s secret base is located. The camera cuts to an interior view of the base. The Pacifist leaders are discussing the latest developments in the war._

*Leader1:*
[We enter at the end of his briefing] ...and finally, a UAF supply station was attacked and destroyed by Confederate forces just over seven hours ago. This attack took place in the Theta sector, near Darhkor. However, rather than attack Darhkor, the Confederates simply left the sector after destroying the supply station. We have no idea why they didn’t wipe out the UAF command center when they had a chance to. It doesn’t make any sense. Our best communications experts are working nonstop right now, trying to decode the various encrypted radio transmissions we intercepted during the attack. Our satellites in the area were damaged and unable to transmit most of the data back here. As a result most of the transmissions have been stranded on the hard drives located at the Satellite Control Center near the attack site. We need to get a Strike Team to that Control Center RIGHT NOW to retrieve that data before the Confederacy gets it. Team 32-G6-A is mobilized and will be launching imminently. Any questions?

_No one moves._

*Leader1:*
Excellent, then we know what we have to do. This meeting is adjourned. Good luck everyone.

_The scene moves to a hangar bay. We see the Strike Team ready to take off. The first of the four ships begins taking off. The camera moves to the first person view of the player character, PC, inside his cockpit. The bay doors open in front of him._

*PC [over the radio]:*
Alright team, you all know the plan. Let’s get that data and get home safely. Good luck.

_The screen cuts to black as soon as he has finished the line. We hear the sounds of his ship taking off and exiting the hangar bay. The sound fades._

h3. Objectives

In the “Objective” sections for each mission, the following terms will be used.

[NO-1] means “New Objective”. The number indicates which objective should be added to the list. The HUD should display “New Objective” and the title of the objective, while the pause menu will provide further details (the second part of each of the objective descriptions below).

[OC-1] means “Objective Complete”. The HUD should inform players that they have finished an objective. The objective should be either crossed off/dimmed off/checked off/etc on the pause menu objective list (so the player can read it later if they want) or should be removed entirely.

Initial Objectives are objectives you receive at the beginning of the mission.

Secondary Objectives are objectives that appear during the mission. They are numbered by which objectives they occur between. For example, 1A comes between 1 and 2, and must be accomplished before moving on to objective 2. These usually come up because of unforeseen events that occur during the mission. If a secondary objective is ongoing and takes place across several main objectives (a secondary objective might have you hunting a certain enemy during the course of 3 main objectives, for example), they will be numbered 1-3A, etc.

Cutscenes do not follow this method. The number on the cutscene (1A for example) is the mission number, and the letter shows which cutscene it is for that mission.

h3. Cutscene 1A

_The camera is at a first-person view from the player’s cockpit, as the ship is docking with the Control Center._

*MEMBER1 [over the radio]:*
This Control Center is normally manned by a crew of about 100, but none of them have been heard from since the attack. I’m not reading any life signs onboard, either. They appear to have been killed in the explosion that took out the supply station. Well need to find a way over to that hatch on the port side once we dock [NO-1]. Then we’ll find the server rooms [NO-2], retrieve the data [NO-3], and get back out here [NO-4]. Remember not to transmit ANY of the data from here. We can’t risk having the information intercepted. That’s why we’re here in the first place.

*PC:*
Alright, sounds good. Let's get this over with.

_The ships dock and the team members exit their ships. They are now standing on the exterior of the Control Point._

h4. Game action

_The team makes it to the port side hatch [OC-1], only to find it has been destroyed in the attack._

*MEMBER3:*
NO! Why can’t these every just be easy? (pause) Alright, let’s find another way in. [NO-1A]

h3. Game action

_The team finds another way in, through a damaged part of the Control Center’s exterior [OC-1A]. Initially, they are simply running through empty halls, with no contact of any kind from the CC crew. About a quarter of the way through, they see the dead bodies of crew members lying in the passageways. Some of them have been abused quite badly. The team is now moving quickly, realizing that something is not right. They begin to notice fresh blood on some of the walls, as well as other signs that a confrontation has recently taken place. After a few more minutes, they encounter some light resistance from AC forces. They immediately go on high alert. The resistance becomes stronger as the team gets closer to the server room. Inside the server room, they find enemy troops already accessing the servers [OC-2]. The resistance in the server room is much heavier than anything encountered in the rest of the level._

*MEMBER3:*
NO NO NO! How’d they get in here already?!

*MEMBER2:*
Kill ‘em all! [NO-2A]

h4. Game action

_The team fights and destroys all AC forces [OC-2A], retrieving data cards containing information about the attack from some of the dead enemies. After confirming that they have destroyed all the enemies in the area, they go about accessing the servers. They each retrieve information from a different server. MEMBER2 stands guard near the door [OC-3]. MEMBER1 is at a server terminal near the back of the room, putting him farthest from the door._

h3. Cutscene 1B:

_The camera moves to a third-person view. As they are working, they do not notice that a droid has come out of hiding in a roof panel. It quietly approaches MEMBER2, who is watching the hallway from just inside the door. As it nears MEMBER2, it steps on a piece of debris on the ground. MEMBER2 glances behind him and notices it._

*MEMBER2:*

HEY--

_He is cut off by the droid, who shoots him in the face. The team members spin around from their terminals and see MEMBER2 as he falls to the ground._

h4. Game action

_The player and MEMBER3 shoot at the droid, but he is a much more powerful model than the ones encountered earlier. He is heavily armored and escapes out the door. MEMBER1 is not close enough to get a shot in before the droid escapes through the door._

*MEMBER3:*
He’s carrying a hard drive! Get it back now! [New objective here? --ed]

*PC:*
Roger that! Let’s go!

h5. Game Action

_The door shuts as the team runs toward the droid standing on the other side, and the droid blasts the ceiling just outside the door (we hear it but do not see it)._

_If the player tries to go through the door, it will open but will be blocked. A large light labeled “AIRLOCK” lights up on the wall near the door. Another door is heard shutting. Through a viewport on the right side of the room, we can see that the droid has launched himself into space and is using a built-in jetpack to fly toward a small cluster of ships. Another light comes on over a control panel, this time marked “RED ALERT”. A siren sounds._

*Computerized voice:*
Warning: Confederate bombers inbound. All hands brace for attack.

h3. Game action

_An explosion rocks the server room. A gaping hole opens in wall on the right of the room, leading out to open space. MEMBER3 is sucked out, screaming. A laser beam obliterates him. MEMBER2’s body and other random pieces of debris are also sucked out. The servers begin to be move as if they are being pulled out, but are securely fastened in place on their racks, which are in turn attached to the ceiling and floor. The player begins sliding toward the hole, being sucked out like MEMBER3. MEMBER1 is barely holding on to a server rack, trying to keep himself from being pulled out. A blast wall slides into place from above and blocks the hole. More explosions shake the room. A panel on the real wall near MEMBER1 explodes and sends him flying across the room, screaming. He writhes, then stops screaming and moving. The explosion also takes out part of the rear wall. They player exits through the destroyed wall. The player runs through the Control Center as it is being bombed to dust by the AC ships, facing light resistance at times. During this part, passages may be blocked with debris and require the player to find a secondary path. He eventually reaches the other side of the Control Center, where his ship is docked. However, as he rounds the corner to the docking bay door, he finds himself face-to-face with a hulking machine. They do battle. They player is severely outgunned in this match. A cutscene is triggered when the droid is defeated._

h3. Cutscene 1C:

_The droid, heavily damaged, blasts the player backwards. The player is on his back, weakened. The droid approaches. The player, dazed, comes (slightly) to his senses and shoots the droid’s knees out, causing it to collapse. The droid tries to crawl forward, but cannot._
  
*Droid:*
Self-destruct activated.

_The droid begins beeping. The player jumps up and staggers toward the door. As he gets closer to the door, the droid explodes. It is far enough away from the door that the explosion does not kill the player, but does throw him against the wall and do damage to his armor and body (shrapnel from the droid’s body cuts him). He staggers out the door to his ship. As he is powering up, he sees the bombers ending their attack and flying off. He takes off and begins to follow them from a safe distance. The camera moves to a third-person view. We see the inside of another ship, from behind the pilot. A blinking light on a control panel indicates that he is locked onto the player. He follows the player from a safe distance like the player is doing to the bombers. We do not see the pilot._

h3. Objectives

# Find a way into the Satellite Control Center
Enter through the access hatch on the port side.
## Find a new way into the Control Center
The access hatch was destroyed in the attack. Find another way in.
# Locate the main data storage servers
They will be located in a large server room on the other side of the Control Center
## Destroy all enemy infantry and reclaim stolen data
AC forces are already in the process of stealing the stored transmissions. Stop them and take back whatever data they may have already taken.
# Retrieve all data from the time of the attack
It is critical that all information be retrieved. There may be information stored on several separate servers. Due to security protocols, they will all need to be accessed manually. Destroy the copies on the servers once you have confirmed that a copy has been saved to your data card.
# Get out of the Control Center and return the data to base
Make sure everyone gets out safely. Return to base. DO NOT TRANSMIT THE DATA. We must make sure it does not have a chance to be intercepted.

h2. Confederate Base Infiltration Mission

h3. Cutscene 2A

_The player follows the Confederate bombers to a base on an empty desert planet. The base resembles a small, walled-in, high-tech city. There is a stark contrast between the terrain and the base itself. The player lands outside sensor range. He will have to trek across the desert to get inside. He is still weak from his battle with the droid. He has sustained several injuries._

h4. Game action

_The player’s health starts very low, at 10-20%, at the programmers discretion. He must get across an expanse of desert. There may be traps, hidden paths, etc. at the discretion of the map designer. Because the player is so weak, he must avoid wild animals, who will easily kill him. He has a weapon but the powerful monsters on the map are mostly too powerful to be killed by it before they kill him._
