Object of the Game
------------------

In LMS, every player starts with a special amount of lives (9 by default) and with (basically) all core [weapons](weapons). For each death you lose 1 life and once you run out of your lives you're eliminated and have to spectate until the end of the match.

The last one that survives is the “Last Man Standing” and wins the match. The player that was eliminated last will rank 2nd, the player that was eliminated before that is 3rd, etc.

Other rules
-----------
- You spawn with 200 health and 200 armor
- Health and armor do NOT regenerate
- Health and armor and ammo items will not spawn
- If you don’t move (e.g. camp or hide) you get hurt after a while and lose some health! So always keep moving.

Special modifiers
-----------------

Extra lives can optionally be enabled in this mode with the cvar `g_lms_extra_lives`. The extra life looks like the [Mega Health](items) Collect the extra life and you get 1 or more extra lives (depending on the value of the setting).
