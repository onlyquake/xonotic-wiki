(and Morphed’s video as game intro)

Samual
\#1: Dokujisans \#27 or \#28 http://www.nullgaming.com/stuff/x/xonotic\_logo\_idea25.jpg (Also using the center piece as the icon for the game)
\#2: ~~z~~’s logo, although i’m not sure how well we can make it into an icon.
\#3: Morphed’s main logo http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/3679/xonoticlogo13.jpg (I like this quite a bit, but I don’t like how overpowering the red is in it.)

As for intro video, morphed’s needs 2 things: \#1: The effects could be worked on and improved greatly.. It’s (No offense) rather poor quality at the moment. Although it would be fine at first, I think our goal is for something smoother and more polished than that \#2: It needs to be 16:9 aspect ratio.

Rad\_Ished
1. Doku \#28

divVerent
1. Dokujisan \#14
2. Taoki logo\_idea\_8 or logo\_idea\_10 or logo\_idea\_11
3. Dokujisan \#28
(4. Morphed xonotic-mp4)

~~z~~’s logos: I like all the phoenixes, but none of the finished logos - the font simply does not work, I read it “xontic”.
Dokujisan’s logos: the ones with X in the logo are unacceptable, as it reads “xonxtic” then.
Morphed: the fire effect is just too much for a good logo - logos should be simple to remember and easy to “draw similarily”

Hew:
Doku \#28
Doku \#26
MirceaKitsune red nodetail

bones\_was\_here
1. Doku \#28
2. MirceaKitsune red nodetail

Xeno:
Dokujisan \#28
(sorry but it’s the only one I really like, so the only one that I’me voting for)

esteel:
- Z’s 1b
- MirceaKitsune’s idea\_8
- Docu’s 23
Also wanna not that the logos should have no special handling of the middle “O” excpet for size maybe.. with an different color then the rest of the name the O tends to not be noticed as a letter but just as goodie for the phoenix..
