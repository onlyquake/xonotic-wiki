Rocket Flying
-------------

**Rocket Flying** is a mutator that makes *rocket jump* maneuvers more effective.

Normally, when you detonate a Devastator rocket direcly below you (look down and hold down secondary fire and press primary fire while in midair), you will experience some force from the explosion. (unless the explosion killed you).

This mutator will tweak the mechanic in such a way that the effective force you receive from this maneuver is increased. This makes this maneuver much more effective, meaning you can fly much higher into the air if you apply this trick correctly.

Hints
-----

* In space maps or maps with a endless abyss, skilled players might use such a rocket jump to rescue themselves from falling down.
