## WARNING! This gamemode has been lost. There is no way to recover this only if the responsible author does. Possibly the author didn't share and it's hard to find him to recover this. The community would be glad to retrieve these gamemode resources.

A group of space terrorists have traitors among them. Traitors must kill terrorists, while the terrorists have to try to find and kill the traitors.

# Objective of the Game

The game mode is based on the fact that there is a small group of traitors and another of detectives, there is an explanation of the functions of each one.


## Innocents

The Innocent are the majority (62.5% of the game's population by default.) Their group color is green.
The task of the innocent is to detect traitors and defend detectives more than anything, they must kill the right person or anything special.


## Traitors

The Traitors are the medium sized group in TTT (25% of the population or one Traitor for every four players.) Their group color is red, but this is not displayed to anyone other than Traitors, or when a Traitor has been confirmed to be dead.
The traitors must murder everyone undetected, they know who they are because only among themselves do they see a red "circle" that blinks around their companions' bodies. They must kill all innocents before time runs out.


## Detectives

The Detectives are the smallest group in TTT (12.5% of the population or one Detective for every eight players.) They are special Innocents given equipment. Their group color is blue.
Detectives have special methods to detect the traitor, for example, when they see a body, they must analyze the body, searching in it until it says a message in the middle "Unidentified", when seeing it, touch the E, if the body was recently killed, it will tell if he was Innocent or a Traitor.

They always appear as CT and everyone sees them as CTs, plus they flash a blue circle on their body that everyone sees (unlike traitors who only see each other CT and the flash is only seen by them).


## About Karma points

It is worth clarifying that everyone can kill each other, but there is something called "**Karma**", which starts with an initial, and increases if they do things right (if traitors kill, or if traitors kill people), otherwise, the Karma will be discounted.

The Karma is used for the damage that weapons generate, the more Karma, the more damage your weapon will do.

If the Karma is lower, the player can be banned temporarily to avoid teamkills or any abuse with the end to keep the game in balance.

Optionally, you can write this too:

`settemp_for_type ttt g_buffs 0`

`settemp_for_type ttt g_new_toys 1`

`settemp_for_type ttt g_random_items 1`

`settemp_for_type ttt g_random_items_powerup_probability 0`
