Jetpack
=======
Overview
--------
The jetpack allows you to fly across the stage. Jetpack can be enabled for everyone with a mutator.

Usage
-----
To use the jetpack, douple-tap and hold the Jump key. You could also press the “jetpack” key which you can assign yourself in the controls settings.

The jetpack needs [fuel](Items) to operate, and it will quickly deplete when you use it.

CVars
-----
Jetpack is enabled with the [CVar](CVars): `g_jetpack` and fine-tined with the CVar family `g_jetpack_*`.
