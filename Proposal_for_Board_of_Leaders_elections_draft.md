Major Xonotic project related decisions (such as gameplay changes) should be made only by **having consensus of all leaders** (each leader has a veto vote).

Art department

-   Lead mapper
-   Lead modeler

Art department is responsible for keeping an unified look of the game, working with other artists, informing them how their creations can go in-game, setting “need to be done” tasks for other artists, supervising the quality of maps which go into base and main Xonotic maps repositories, providing artists with texture and prop sets and other art related activities.

Audio department
----------------

-   Music director
-   Sound director

Audio department is responsible for keeping an unified audio and visual experience, creating/finding new audio content which would be used by the game, creating guidelines for other audio artists, setting “need to be done” tasks for other artists and other audio related activities.

Code department
---------------

-   Lead developer and game designer
-   Lead quality assurance engineer

Code department is responsible for creating and maintaining game codebase, assuring that code is free of bugs before release is made, working with other code developers, setting “need to be done” coding tasks and other coding related activities.

Public relationships department
-------------------------------

-   Lead community manager

Public relationships department is responsible for keeping community informed about news happening in Xonotic world, advertising the game in mass media, organizing community activities such as tournaments and other events, gathering community opinions about the game and informing about those other developers, organizing fund raising campaigns to speed up project development and doing other project related activities.

Groups appointed by the Bord of Leaders
---------------------------------------

Board of Leaders can create other groups on demand with some special purpose. Examples of such groups are:

-   Quality assurance group
-   Tracker and wiki maintaining group
-   Documentation group

Election process
----------------

Voting is done by all those who are registered at development tracker at dev.xonotic.org [Ed. Note: Now at https://gitlab.com/xonotic] Those supposedly are community members who help game development and have clues how inner game development is going on. Leaders are elected for 2 year terms and can be reelected again after their service time finished. If somebody leaves the board during the service time, new elections are made and elected person serves the remaining time until new elections.
Votes are counted using Borda Count method: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count

For example, in an election for a leader position with 6 candidates, the rankings are scored as follows:

    rank points
    1______6
    2______5
    3______4
    4______3
    5______2
    6______1
    none___0

Thus, refusing to rank someone denies them any points at all. Of course each rank can be assigned to at most one candidate.
Candidate with the highest point total is elected to the board to fill the position he was elected for.
