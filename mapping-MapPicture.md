Make your map sexy !  
Your map should include a preview picture. This picture will be visible from the game menu and from the servers vote screen.

In order to do so:
*  Load your map in the game
*  Use the command `r_letterbox -1` in the console to turn off the HUD
*  If your map has "waypoint" entities (like CTF or CTS maps), you can hide them with `cl_hidewaypoints 1`
*  Take a nice screenshot with F12
*  Go to your Xonotic user directory, on the `data/screenshot` subdirectory. Your user directory location depends on your operating system, more information [here](https://xonotic.org/faq/#where-are-the-configuration-files-located).
*  Open the screenshot with an image editor, e.g. GIMP
*  Crop it so that it has a 4:3 ratio
*  Scale it to 512x512 px (weird but standard)
*  Save it as a JPG file (~90% quality)
*  Put it in the same location as the bsp file, with the same name (see next chapter for packaging rules).
