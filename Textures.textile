h1. Textures in Xonotic

{{>toc}}

There are 2 material/texture systems in Xonotic that can work together.

h2. System one

This system is based off of the texture name, with the suffix denoting what the texture describes.

|_. Texture name |_. Filename |_. Description |
| Diffuse | texturename.tga | This is the texture as it will look to an observer without lighting or any other effects. |
| Normal | texturename_norm.tga | Xonotic uses OpenGL style tangent space normal map (Inverted Y/green channel). You can put height map in normal maps alpha channel and it will be used when offset or relief mapping is on. This will give your texture a 3d look. |
|/2.Alpha channel | texturename_norm.tga |If the TGA image is 32bits, the alpha channel will be loaded from the image. |
| texturename_alpha.jpg | *note ONLY works with jpg at the moment* (What does this mean? Why is there a tga entry for this then?)|
| Bump map | texturename_bump.tga | Bump maps are like normal maps in that they allow a texture to be 3d. However, normal maps have higher priorities and so will overwrite bump maps. It is a better idea to use a normal map instead of a bump map, since the roughness of a bump map is limited by a cvar. |
| Specular | texturename_gloss.tga | This map will make your texture more or less shiny. There may be colors in this map. |
| Fullbright | texturename_glow.tga | Areas textured with this map will always glow and shadows will not affect them. |
| Team color/custom | texturename_pants.tga | Areas textured with this map will show the user's custom or team color. Make it grayscale and leave same area 100% black in diffuse texture. |
| Shirt | texturename_shirt.tga | Like the above, but a secondary color. *Does this still exist?* |


h2. System two

Second material system is simplified Quake 3â„¢ shader system.
The main difference is that you can use only 1 pass, with a few exceptions:
* Lightmap pass is allowed 
* Blend shaders are allowed (blending two diffuse textures + lightmap). Same syntax as in quake3.
