Blood Loss
----------

Blood Loss is a mutator in which players who are below a certain health threshold (for example: 25) will suffer blood loss. Blood loss makes players stunned, severely impairs movement and rapidly takes away health points until they either die or gain enough health to go above the blood loss threshold.
