Powerups
========

Powerups spawn from time to time in the arena and grant to whoever collects them a temporary super power.  Powerups last for 30 seconds by default. Powerups will also be shown in the radar and the HUD 10 seconds before they appear.

Shield

With the Shield you only take 33% of the damage you would normally receive.

Strength
--------

Strength increases the damage you deal by a factor of 3. The force/knockback that attacks cause is also greatly increased.
